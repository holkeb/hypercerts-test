# Terms of use
The following terms and conditions govern all use of the hypercerts.org and hypercerts.xyz websites (the “Websites”) and all content, software and products available at or through the Website, including the creation, redemption, and display of hypercerts tokens using code available within the repositories of https://github.com/hypercerts-org  (“hypercerts” or the “Platform”).  

Please read these terms carefully.  If you don’t agree to all of these terms and conditions (“Terms” or “TOS”), you are prohibited from using or accessing these Websites or using the Platform.  

The Hypercert Foundation (“we,” “us”) may make changes to these Terms from time to time. Your continued use of or access to the Websites or the Platform following the posting of any changes to the Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.  If you don’t agree to these revisions, you should stop using the Websites and Platform.

## Redemption of hypercerts
Hypercerts constitute an experimental, discretionary platform to incentivize funding of public goods – this is not a competition. You acknowledge that, at this time, hypercerts are non-transferrable and cannot be traded for value.

We may discontinue providing the Platform at any time, and **there is no guarantee that your use of the Platform will result in any reward.**  If you become eligible for a reward or payment, you may need to provide us with additional information and/or agree to additional terms and conditions.  

You are responsible for any expenses that may become due because of your use of the Platform, including in connection with accepting or receiving a reward. Your receipt and use of any reward payment may have significant tax consequences, and you are solely responsible for any taxes due as a result of any reward / payment.  You acknowledge and agree that we may (in our sole discretion) be required to withhold taxes from some rewards or payments and that we may be required to report payments you receive through the Platform to the relevant tax authorities. You also acknowledge that you may be required to provide additional information if you choose to request a copy of any applicable documentation related to any such tax withholding, rewards or payment information that is reported to the relevant tax authorities.  You also acknowledge that it’s your obligation, if you so desire, to seek independent counsel to determine the full extent of your tax liability under applicable laws and regulations.  Nothing on the Websites or within the Platform constitutes tax advice.

To receive any rewards, you must provide a crypto wallet address that has been whitelisted by the relevant project you’re claiming a hypercert for. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to receive any rewards via the wallet details you provide to us. You may not claim a reward if: you reject your reward; you do not provide the required information for reward delivery; or if you do not comply with the rules and requirements herein.  

The offer or payment of any reward through the Platform does not constitute an offer of employment or any similar legal relationship between you and any other entity, including us.

If you are on any U.S. or E.U. sanctions list, or residing in any U.S. or E.U.-sanctioned region, you may not use the Websites or Platform and will not be eligible for any reward or payment.
